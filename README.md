# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-AI

### What the application is about:
A web application consisting of an undefeatable and a trainable AI Tic-Tac-Toe game

### Introduction
This application was made to show the different ways in which one can implement an AI through a simple game such as Tic-Tac-Toe.
We propose to develop a two player game of Tic-Tac-Toe, where one player is the computer itself. This is done with the help of a pre-coded algorithm or 
a trainable AI. The algorithm developed helps the computer to decide the most appropriate move so as to either win the game or to draw it in the least amount of time.
