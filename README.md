# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-AI

### What the application is about:
A web application consisting of an undefeatable and a trainable AI Tic-Tac-Toe game

### Introduction
This application was made to show the different ways in which one can implement an AI through a simple game such as Tic-Tac-Toe.
We propose to develop a two player game of Tic-Tac-Toe, where one player is the computer itself. This is done with the help of a pre-coded algorithm or 
a trainable AI. The algorithm developed helps the computer to decide the most appropriate move so as to either win the game or to draw it in the least amount of time.

### Concepts implemented in the application
<ul>
  <li> 
    Minmax - We implement the algorithm called the Minimax algorithm which is a recursive or backtracking algorithm which is used in decision-making and game theory. The     simulation algorithm is presented to predict the win, or draw of a game by knowing the first move of a player.
  </li>
  <li>
    The project also implements a trainable AI which is also implemented in JavaScript with the help of the TensorFlow library that allows the user to train the AI based     on the games he/she has played in the UI as a training input.
  </li>
</ul>
